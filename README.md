# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning-based project aimed at analyzing and identifying human emotions from speech data. The system processes audio inputs to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. This project leverages advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate emotion predictions.

## Features
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), chroma, and spectral contrast from audio signals.
- **Emotion Classification**: Detects and classifies emotions into predefined categories.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN, or RNN) to train on labeled datasets.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Capable of processing live audio or pre-recorded audio files.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: Publicly available datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or custom datasets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the audio dataset using the `data_preprocessing.py` script.
2. Train the model using the `train_model.py` script.
3. Use the `predict.py` script to classify emotions in new audio files.

## Example
```bash
python predict.py --file sample_audio.wav
```
Output:
```
Predicted Emotion: Happy
```
